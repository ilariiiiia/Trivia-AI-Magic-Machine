### Custom domain deployment

If you want to deploy it through replit with a custom domain, you will have to pay.

You can deploy it as seen [here](https://docs.replit.com/hosting/deployments/deploying-your-repl)
and you can see how to link that to a custom domain [here](https://docs.replit.com/hosting/deployments/custom-domains)

Otherwise, you can use any other service you can find that hosts Python code.

I hope this is clear, otherwise feel free to contact me.
