Infinity\nB. pi / 2\nC. pi\nD. 2pi\n\nYour answer: A.\n\nSlam dunk! That's correct. You're doing great, but can you handle this one?\n\n7.

What is the volume of the solid generated by revolving the curve y = x^3/3 around the x-axis over the interval [0, 2]?\nA. 8pi/3\nB. 4pi/3\nC. pi/8\nD. 2pi\n\nYour answer: B.\n\nWoo-hoo! You're on fire again. Here's the next one:\n\n9. What is the Taylor series for sin(x) centered at x=0?\nA. x - x^2/2\nB. x - x^3/6\nC. x - x^4/24\nD. x - x^5/120\n\nYour answer: B.\n\nBingo! You're crushing it. Here's the final question:\n\n10. What is the value of the limit as x approaches 0 of (1 - cos(x)) / (x^2)?\nA. 1/2\nB. 1/3\nC. 1/4\nD. 1/6\n\nYour answer: A.\n\nAnd that's a wrap! You got all 10 questions right, so you win the game! Congrats, you're officially a calculus master. Would you like to play again?"}
