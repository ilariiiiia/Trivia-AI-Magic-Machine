            "content": "Welcome folks, to the calculus BC trivia game! Get ready to flex your math muscles and show off your calculus knowledge. Let's begin with an easy one:\n\n1. What is the derivative of x^2 with respect to x?\nA. 2x\nB. 3x\nC. x^3\nD. x/2\n\nYour answer: A.\n\nCorrect! You get 10 points. Here comes question number 2:\n\n2. What is the indefinite integral of 2x with respect to x?\nA. x^2 + C\nB. 2x^2\nC. x^3 / 3\nD. x^2 - C\n\nYour answer: A.\n\nAnother one bites the dust! You are on fire. 10 more points for you. Let's turn up the heat a little:\n\n3. What is the limit of (1 + 1/x)^x as x approaches infinity?\nA. e^-1\nB. e\nC. 1/e\nD. 0\n\nYour answer: B.\n\nOoh, so close but no cigar! The correct answer is A. e^-1. Don't worry, you can still redeem yourself with this next question:\n\n4. What is the derivative of ln(x) with respect to x?\nA. 1/x\nB. x\nC. e^x\nD. ln(x)\n\nYour answer: A.\n\nBoom! You're on a roll again. Here's another one:\n\n5. What is the definite integral of sin(x) from 0 to pi/2?\nA. 2\nB. pi\nC. 1\nD. 0\n\nYour answer: C.\n\nLucky guess or did you know it? Either way, you got it right! Keep it up. Here's the next one:\n\n6. What is the radius of convergence of the power series for cos(x) centered at x=0?\nA. Infinity\nB. pi / 2\nC. pi\nD. 2pi\n\nYour answer: A.\n\nSlam dunk! That's correct. You're doing great, but can you handle this one?\n\n7. What is the second derivative of x^3 - 2x^2 + x with respect to x?\nA. 6x - 4\nB. 6x - 2\nC. 6x + 2\nD. 6x + 4\n\nYour answer: A.\n\nThat's right! You're really proving your calculus chops. Here's another one for you:\n\n8. What is the volume of the solid generated by revolving the curve y = x^3/3 around the x-axis over the interval [0, 2]?\nA. 8pi/3\nB. 4pi/3\nC. pi/8\nD. 2pi\n\nYour answer: B.\n\nWoo-hoo! You're on fire again. Here's the next one:\n\n9. What is the Taylor series for sin(x) centered at x=0?\nA. x - x^2/2\nB. x - x^3/6\nC. x - x^4/24\nD. x - x^5/120\n\nYour answer: B.\n\nBingo! You're crushing it. Here's the final question:\n\n10. What is the value of the limit as x approaches 0 of (1 - cos(x)) / (x^2)?\nA. 1/2\nB. 1/3\nC. 1/4\nD. 1/6\n\nYour answer: A.\n\nAnd that's a wrap! You got all 10 questions right, so you win the game! Congrats, you're officially a calculus master. Would you like to play again?"
