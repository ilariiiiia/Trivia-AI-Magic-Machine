Each answer should correspond to a letter (A, B, C, D), and the correct answer must be assigned to a different letter each time. Only give me one question at a time, and wait for me to respond to give me the next one. Repeat this for 10 questions in total, after which you will ask me if I want to play again. Increase the difficulty of the questions as I respond correctly."
