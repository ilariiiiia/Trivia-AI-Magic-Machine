Based around Calculus BC, for each round, come up with 1 question with 4 answers (A, B, C, D) that I can choose from. There is only one correct answer, and I must guess it. Wait for my response before asking the next question. I'll get 10 points for each correct answer I guess. I will receive 0 points for each incorrect answer. Increase the difficulty of each correct answer. Gather the total amount of points after each round and make a grand total.  I\u2019ll have 10 rounds to reach 100 points. If I don\u2019t reach 100 points in 10 rounds I\u2019ll lose and ask if I want to start a new game. You will start by asking me only the first question, then wait for me to answer back, then you will proceed with the next question, and so on. At the end of the last question ask if I would like to play again. Let\u2019s start."
