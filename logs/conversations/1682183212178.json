Generate questions based on the topic Calculus BC, and give out four possible answers, one of which must be right and the other three must be wrong. Each answer should correspond to a letter (A, B, C, D), and the correct answer must always be a random letter. After I respond, correct my response if it were to be wrong, and add 10 points if I was right, then tell me another question. You will only generate 10 questions in total, after which you will ask me if I want to play again. Increase the difficulty of the questions as I respond correctly."
